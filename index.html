	<h1> Dhrumil's Simple Website </h1>
	<h4> 10/25/2059 by: Somebody </h4>

	<p> I'm building this website in the process of learning about github. </p>

	<p> This is a pretend article about vegetables. Specifically how long they are and what color they are. There are lots of vegetables in the world and they are of various collllors. They can be white, blue or yellow; but there are no neon vegegegetables in nature. That is why this article is so important to inform you about types of vegetables. Once you're done reading, you should be able to identify whether or not what you're eating is a vegetable. </p>


	<!-- This is a placeholder for the table of vegetables.-->
	<h5> Vegetables on my shopping list. </h5>
	<div id='veggiestable'></div>

	<p> As you can see in the table above, my shopping list has vegetables of various colors. </p>

	<p> First, let's talk about pOtaYToes. Your average potato is 6 inches long and 5 inches wide. Of course, there are various types of potatos, but if you took every single potato of every size, shape and variety, they are roughly that size on average. Addionally, most potatoes are brown. Some are white and some are yellow; some are sweet and some are mellow. But potatoes are potatoes and on average they are brown. </p>
